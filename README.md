Time spent: 4 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [x] UI animations
* [x] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

## Notes

While building the app, I faced many challenges. This was my first time working in Objective-C, and thus had much to learn in terms of syntax, blocks, and various other components. I had also never worked with animations before, but found that there is much that I still need to explore in that area. Saving information also proved to be more difficult than I anticipated, but after figuring out how to save the default tip value, saving the bill value became much easier.
